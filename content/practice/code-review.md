## What is it?

Code Review is a software quality assurance activity that someone other than the author(s) checks the relevant piece of code and considers questions like:

* **TL;DR:** Is the code [clean](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/)? :)
* **Design:** Is the code well-designed and appropriate for your system?
* **Functionality:** Does the code behave as the developer likely intended? Is it the right behavior for users?
* **Complexity:** Could the code be made simpler? Would another developer be able to easily understand and use this code when they come across it in the future? As Martin Fowler states in his book [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/refactoring-improving-the/9780134757681/):

  > Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
* **Tests:** Does the code have correct and well-designed automated tests?
* **Naming:** Did the developer choose clear names for variables, classes, methods, etc.?
* **Comments:** Are the comments clear and useful?
* **Style:** Does the code follow our style guides?
* **Documentation:** Did the developer also update relevant documentation?
