Code Review is a software quality assurance activity that someone other than the author(s) checks the relevant piece of code and considers questions like:

* Is the code is aligned with the formatting or style guidelines?
* Is there any logic errors?
* Are the classes etc. fully implemented due to the requirements?
* Are there any tests written, or the current tests sufficient for the new code?
